Okay, let's break down how to set up and use a local Python environment with `uv` after you've installed it.

`uv` aims to be a very fast, drop-in replacement for `pip` and `venv` (and potentially other tools like `pip-tools`). The workflow is similar to using `venv` and `pip`, but often faster and integrated.

**1. Creating the Virtual Environment**

The core command is `uv venv`. You typically create a virtual environment within your project directory. The standard convention is to name the environment directory `.venv`.

* **Navigate to your project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```
* **Create the environment:**
    ```bash
    uv venv
    ```
    This command creates a directory named `.venv` in your current location, containing a Python interpreter and necessary scripts.

* **Specifying a Python Interpreter (Optional):**
    If you have multiple Python versions installed and want to use a specific one for this environment, you can specify it:
    ```bash
    # Example: Use Python 3.11 if available
    uv venv -p 3.11

    # Or provide a full path
    uv venv -p /usr/bin/python3.11
    ```
    If you don't specify, `uv` will try to find a suitable Python interpreter on your system.

**2. Activating the Environment**

Activating the environment modifies your shell's `PATH` so that commands like `python`, `pip` (and `uv` itself when used for package management *within* the environment) refer to the versions inside `.venv`. This isolates your project's dependencies.

The activation command depends on your shell:

* **Bash or Zsh (Linux/macOS):**
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
* **Fish Shell (Linux/macOS):**
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate.fish
    ```
* **PowerShell (Windows):**
    ```powershell
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```
    (You might need to adjust your PowerShell execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`)
* **Command Prompt (cmd.exe) (Windows):**
    ```cmd
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

Once activated, you'll usually see the environment name (e.g., `(.venv)`) prepended to your shell prompt.

**3. Managing Dependencies (Installing Packages)**

With the environment activated, you use `uv pip` commands to manage packages *within that specific environment*.

* **Install packages:**
    ```bash
    uv pip install requests
    uv pip install "django>=4.0" flask beautifulsoup4
    ```
* **Install from a requirements file:**
    If you have a `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
* **Install from `pyproject.toml`:**
    If your project uses a `pyproject.toml` file (with dependencies defined under `[project]` or `[tool.pdm]`, etc., though `uv` primarily focuses on the standard `[project.dependencies]`):
    ```bash
    # Installs the package defined in the current directory's pyproject.toml
    uv pip install .

    # Install optional dependency groups if defined (e.g., [project.optional-dependencies])
    uv pip install ".[dev, test]"
    ```
* **Syncing with a requirements file:**
    Use `uv pip sync` to ensure your environment *exactly* matches the requirements file. It will install missing packages and *uninstall* any packages present in the environment but *not* listed in the file. This is great for reproducibility.
    ```bash
    uv pip sync requirements.txt
    ```
* **Listing installed packages:**
    ```bash
    uv pip list
    ```
* **Generating a requirements file:**
    ```bash
    uv pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    This captures the currently installed packages and their exact versions into `requirements.txt`.

**4. Deactivating the Environment**

When you're finished working on the project, you can deactivate the environment to return to your global Python context:

```bash
deactivate
```
This command works across all the shells mentioned above.

**Files and Scripts Involved**

* **`.venv` Directory:** This is the main directory created by `uv venv`. It contains:
    * `bin/` (or `Scripts/` on Windows): Contains the Python executable for the environment, the `activate` scripts, and executables installed by packages (like `flask`, `django-admin`, etc.).
    * `lib/` (or `Lib/` on Windows): Contains installed Python packages.
    * `pyvenv.cfg`: A configuration file specifying details about the environment.
* **Activation Scripts:** (`activate`, `activate.fish`, `Activate.ps1`, `activate.bat`) These are the scripts inside `.venv/bin` (or `.venv/Scripts`) that you `source` or run to activate the environment. You don't typically edit these.
* **`requirements.txt` (Common Practice):** A text file where you list the packages your project needs, often with specific versions (e.g., `requests==2.28.1`). You create and manage this file. `uv pip freeze` generates it, and `uv pip install -r` / `uv pip sync` uses it.
* **`pyproject.toml` (Modern Standard):** The modern standard for Python project configuration, including dependencies. If you use this, `uv pip install .` will install dependencies specified within it.

**Typical Workflow Summary**

1.  `cd my_project`
2.  `uv venv .venv` (Only needs to be done once per project)
3.  `source .venv/bin/activate` (Do this every time you start working in a new terminal)
4.  `uv pip install requests` (Install new packages as needed)
5.  `uv pip freeze > requirements.txt` (Update requirements file after installing/updating)
    * *Alternatively, manually edit `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` and then run `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` or `uv pip sync requirements.txt` or `uv pip install .`*
6.  *Work on your project code...*
7.  `deactivate` (When you're done)

Remember to add `.venv` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing the entire virtual environment to version control. Only commit your source code and dependency definition files (`requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`).
